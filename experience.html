Being a cricket lover, I teamed up with few of my friends and resurrected the Georgia Tech Cricket Club. The aim of this organization is to provide an established structure to the recreational cricket games and increase the awareness of the sport on campus. Just over a term of one semester, we formed a full eleven-player team that has represented GT at the state level Spring 2018 Knockout tournament, GATA Fall 2018 Knockout Tournament, and various other shorter formats on GT Campus. Future goals include growing the organization by acquiring good talent, participating in state-level tournaments and organizing GT Cricket league.
