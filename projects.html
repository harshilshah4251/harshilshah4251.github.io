                    Created a python script that would run through all files on my computer and create a select list of files that need to be backed up based on the rules defined. The shell script would initiate the backup process at the defined time and push all the files to a private github page. 
                    When the repository gets too big, the past commits are deleted until the size is under the allowed threshold and then the new push is executed.

                    <p class="small-italics-description-text">May, 2018 - August, 2018</p>
                    <p class="small-description-text">K9 is a functional impact and a regression analysis tool. Because software companies have a huge code base with lots of developers working on it constantly, it becomes difficult for a single developer to be aware of the state of the code with respect to what areas are being changed/impacted. This "state-blind" situation before code drops and deployments is leading to lots of regression and unanticipated issues. Hence, a demand for a functional impact tool, K9, was created.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small-description-text">I single-handedly worked on K9 building it from ground up under the guidance of my project manager. By the end of my internship, I was able to produce a deliverable product that can be used in the real world before deployments. K9 collects changes to the code base from the version control system and maps those changes to functional areas within the repository where the change occurred. This way, K9 is helping in approaching and attacking unanticipated developments with the code in a scientific manner by replacing the breadth-based traditional approach at testing.</p>

                    <p class="small-description-text"> Capital One organizes a highly competitive Software Engineering Summit for freshmen and sophomores in college. To qualify for the program, I created a web application that computes and displays insightful data analysis of the San Francisco Emergency Dispatch System. I used React JS to build this web app that interacts with the PostgreSQL database on the backend to collect data and perform data analysis.

                    <p class="small-italics-description-text">October, 2017</p>

                    <p class="small-description-text"> One of the responsibilities of working as a web developer for the Ivan Allen College, Georgia Tech includes building HTML newsletters that are embedded into an email client and sent out to the students of the college. These newsletters are emailed out on a biweekly basis and require manipulating the raw HTML file every time while creating a new letter. This was a very inefficient, time-consuming, and tedious process. Hence, I created a user interface and a PHP backend that allows the user to just enter the event name, date, location, time and description and the tool will create a processed HTML page based on the user provided information.</p>

                    <p class="small-description-text">This was a small change however, this automation has saved a lot of time spent on editing HTML files manually by replacing it with a user-facing interactive UI. The tool is being also used by several people within the department to generate email newsletters in a timely fashion.</p>
